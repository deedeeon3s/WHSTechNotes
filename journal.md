The New Cell Phone Law cer
My thoughts on the new cellphone law. The new cell phone law is useless in my opinion kids still be on their phones and have airpods in their ears. My text states that the kids in our school still have their cell phones and electronics. This law isnt going no where with that and the teachers are soft and dont care and also be on their phone and say this is just a law for us?. If this law is just for use why ban all phones in school?. This cellphone ban should be unbanned because what if we have an shooter or something happens in the school. How are the teachers gonna be notified that we have that happening and going on at the moment but yetwe still dont have phones and personally this ban needs to get dropped asap. My evidence supports my claim because the cellphone ban was unnessasary and foolish if i was president i wouldnt do this i also said in my evidence how teaachers still be on their phone but we cant i thought this ban was for everyone not just students if phones are banned in school every phone and electronic should be too.

   I am interested in engineering because ive always wanted to be and engineer like work on computers and all that type of stuff. Engineering is my dream job/goal and i would like to acomplish that goal and stay ontop of everything instead of playing in the hall with these girls messing around. I would like to archieve my goal and lock it in place so i can stay ontop of everything. The reason i would like to be and engineer is because i always kept the same dream ever since i was little and i will never let my dream ive had for over years go away till i acomplish that singular goal. Another reason i would love to engineer because i love to work on computers and tvs, phones all that stuff i wanna know how to build sofwares and coding stuff like that.

This year's White House Presidential AI Challenge is an excellent opportunity for students to apply AI to real-world issues. My AI project idea is to create an educational tool that uses AI to personalize learning for K-12 students. This tool would adapt to each student's pace and style, providing customized lessons and activities based on their performance and engagement. The project meets the challenge requirements by using AI ethically to assist in education and by being a creative yet realistic solution to the long-standing problem of standardized curricula failing to meet diverse learning needs. This AI-powered tool would be incredibly useful, helping to improve educational outcomes by ensuring every student receives the support they need to succeed and empowering teachers with data-driven insights to better assist their students.

Working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for the future of jobs.The IKEA and Roblox experiment offers real jobs with real pay, which expands the traditional idea of who can work and how. Many Gen Z individuals already spend significant time on platforms like Roblox, and offering paid work there provides an entry point for them into the workforce. This also creates job opportunities that may not be possible in the physical world, such as giving people with social anxiety or physical limitations a chance to work and gain experience. This evidence supports the claim because it shows how virtual environments can democratize work, making it accessible to people who might otherwise face barriers. It also demonstrates how technology can create new economic models, integrating gaming and work into a single experience. As more companies explore these innovative approaches, virtual workplaces will likely become an integral part of a diversified job market.

it started from a viral meme or lebron joke shared widely online. Perhaps it originated from a funny video or catchy song that spread rapidly. Students now use it playfully in various school settings like classrooms or hallways. The phrase carries a light humorous tone signaling connection among those familiar with its origin. Its popularity likely stems from this shared understanding and the joy of an inside joke. This repetition makes it confusing yet intriguing to outsiders.

As school leader, my technology policy would focus on promoting responsible use, fostering critical thinking, and ensuring a focused learning environment. Cell phones would be stored in designated classroom caddies during instructional time to minimize distractions and encourage social interaction, with exceptions for teacher-directed activities and emergencies. School-issued Chromebooks would be for academic purposes only, with robust web filtering to block non-educational games and inappropriate content.

The prompt i made was about how im suppose to teach kids about domain and range is algebra 1 honors because why not.  Canva interpreted it by making the quiz and teaching me about it myself as a highschool student. The quiz part of canva ai worked the best because i dont even know domain and range for real an i got 2 wrong out of 3. How i could  improve the quiz canva made is by making it more understanding like instead of bold words make it like into words understandable for incoming high schoolers. Canva ai helped very well but at the end of the day ai is wrong most of the time.

1. What’s the problem? Why is it a big deal if SNAP runs out of funding? Who might be most affected?
The problem was a lapse in federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) due to the government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025. It is a big deal because SNAP is the nation's largest anti-hunger program, providing essential aid to over 42 million Americans. The people most affected are some of the most vulnerable populations in the U.S., with approximately 70% of participants being children, the elderly, or people with disabilities. Most SNAP households have incomes at or below the federal poverty level, and for many, SNAP is their only form of direct assistance for food. every $1 in SNAP benefits generates an estimated $1.50 in economic activity. Local food banks and charities, though they step up, are guaranteed to be inadequate to replace the federal government's $8 billion in monthly aid.
2. How could technology help?
Resource Locators: Apps and websites can provide a regularly updated, centralized map or directory of local food banks, pantries, and free meal programs, including hours of operation and available services.Benefit Management: Tools like the Propel app can help users manage their EBT balances, check for payment updates during funding uncertainty, and find information on benefit renewal requirements.Navigation and Access: Websites and helplines, like the national 211 service, can provide information and refer people to various aid programs beyond just food assistance.Online Applications: Simplifying the application and recertification processes for benefits online could reduce administrative burdens and ensure people get help more quickly.
3. What challenges might exist?
Digital Divide: Not everyone has access to a reliable internet connection, a smartphone, or a computer.Usability and Literacy: Some individuals, particularly the elderly, may face barriers related to tech literacy or the complexity of online systems.Privacy and Trust: Users may have concerns about their personal data and privacy when using third-party apps or websites to manage sensitive information.Information Overload/Accuracy: During a crisis, information can be chaotic, and ensuring that online resources are accurate and up-to-date across all localities can be difficult.
4. If you were the designer
Harvest Connect would be a simple, lightweight mobile app and companion website designed for maximum accessibility (low data usage, works offline where possible, available in multiple languages.

During the holidays, technology has changed celebrations, enabling virtual connections but sometimes at the cost of in-person interactions.

Focusing on online sharing can replace in-person interaction.Reasoning: Developers have a moral obligation to build gadgets with privacy and potential family distraction in mind.Reasoning: Unchecked tech use can lead to a "digital divide". The line between public sharing and private moments can become blurred.Reasoning: Developers should prioritize privacy and encourage mindful device use. This ensures technology serves as a tool for connection.
