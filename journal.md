The New Cell Phone Law cer
My thoughts on the new cellphone law. The new cell phone law is useless in my opinion kids still be on their phones and have airpods in their ears. My text states that the kids in our school still have their cell phones and electronics. This law isnt going no where with that and the teachers are soft and dont care and also be on their phone and say this is just a law for us?. If this law is just for use why ban all phones in school?. This cellphone ban should be unbanned because what if we have an shooter or something happens in the school. How are the teachers gonna be notified that we have that happening and going on at the moment but yetwe still dont have phones and personally this ban needs to get dropped asap. My evidence supports my claim because the cellphone ban was unnessasary and foolish if i was president i wouldnt do this i also said in my evidence how teaachers still be on their phone but we cant i thought this ban was for everyone not just students if phones are banned in school every phone and electronic should be too.
