The New Cell Phone Law cer
My thoughts on the new cellphone law. The new cell phone law is useless in my opinion kids still be on their phones and have airpods in their ears. My text states that the kids in our school still have their cell phones and electronics. This law isnt going no where with that and the teachers are soft and dont care and also be on their phone and say this is just a law for us?. If this law is just for use why ban all phones in school?. This cellphone ban should be unbanned because what if we have an shooter or something happens in the school. How are the teachers gonna be notified that we have that happening and going on at the moment but yetwe still dont have phones and personally this ban needs to get dropped asap. My evidence supports my claim because the cellphone ban was unnessasary and foolish if i was president i wouldnt do this i also said in my evidence how teaachers still be on their phone but we cant i thought this ban was for everyone not just students if phones are banned in school every phone and electronic should be too.

   I am interested in engineering because ive always wanted to be and engineer like work on computers and all that type of stuff. Engineering is my dream job/goal and i would like to acomplish that goal and stay ontop of everything instead of playing in the hall with these girls messing around. I would like to archieve my goal and lock it in place so i can stay ontop of everything. The reason i would like to be and engineer is because i always kept the same dream ever since i was little and i will never let my dream ive had for over years go away till i acomplish that singular goal. Another reason i would love to engineer because i love to work on computers and tvs, phones all that stuff i wanna know how to build sofwares and coding stuff like that.

This year's White House Presidential AI Challenge is an excellent opportunity for students to apply AI to real-world issues. My AI project idea is to create an educational tool that uses AI to personalize learning for K-12 students. This tool would adapt to each student's pace and style, providing customized lessons and activities based on their performance and engagement. The project meets the challenge requirements by using AI ethically to assist in education and by being a creative yet realistic solution to the long-standing problem of standardized curricula failing to meet diverse learning needs. This AI-powered tool would be incredibly useful, helping to improve educational outcomes by ensuring every student receives the support they need to succeed and empowering teachers with data-driven insights to better assist their students.
